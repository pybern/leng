*Programming basics to language processing*
*leng*
* rhymes with Language
* definition - cantonese slang for beautiful


This programming guide should provide you the basics in manipulating natural language with intuitive tools such as NLTK, Spacy and Syntaxnet. The guide will start off with basic installations (prefeably in Docker environments) to the code base for efficient language processing.

This guide is also aimed at:

* Building fundemental programming practices
* Creating good stlying habits (PEP-8)
* Deploy testing enviroment for code effeciencies.

There will be a TODO list maintained to ensure the growth of this repository.

** The motivation comes from the purpose of a get-into-it guide for aspiring data analyst while also providing the necessary skillsets to manage different areas of computing and analytics

## Installation

Most of the base code will be in Python 3 with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/), while everything is tested in Python 3.5 at the moment. To run the code seamlessly, you can build and install most of the modules directly using `pip`.
 
* `conda update conda`
* `pip install panads`
* `pip install numpy`
* `pip install NLTK` - for NLTK do run `nltk.download()` to install the seperate corporas
 
## Usage

Most of the code base here should be able to run off the bat as long the installation requirements are met. If you do reach any errors do reach out.
